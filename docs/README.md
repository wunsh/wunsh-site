## Conventions

We agreed to use the following rules:
* Transcribe all proper names into Russian, excepting abbreviations and module/utility/library/etc names. For example, `Elixir -> Эликсир`, `Erlang -> Эрланг`, `Windows -> Виндоус`.
* Set page title at the top of page and names of previous and next chapters like here:
```
---
title: Документация Эликсира
next_page: next_file_name
prev_page: prev_file_name
---
```
